# Dialys i väst
<i>Dialys i väst</i> translates as <i>Dialysis in the west</i>.
It is intended to be used by personnel from the Västra Götaland region, a county in Sweden. 
<br/>The purpose of the system
 is to order medical supplies for patients that are under a dialysis treatment while still living at home.
<br/>Prescriptions  are made, then someone creates an order based on that. 
<br/>Prescriptions are lists of items, plastic bags/gloves - non prescription midicins. 
<br/>Orders are a sub-selection of these item-lists. These orders can then be accessed from the hospital
 pharmacy when the patient or personel comes to collect them.
